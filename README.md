# Project1

- from testing new project with this in visual studio - weather app template with .NET back end and react front end:

- run locally:  dotnet run  C:\Users\miwan\Desktop\Git\NET GraphQL App\Project1\Project1\Project1.csproj
- can also just use ctrl + f5 
- docker wouldn't work even after 2 hours of debugging.  hosted server part but not react front end.
